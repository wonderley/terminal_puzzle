Implementation of Tetris Attack using Node and blessed.js.

In principle the game can be run in any terminal. However currently the terminal only works properly on Mac OSX Terminal.

To run:

  npm install

  bin/game_controller.js

Use the arrow keys or the h, j, k and l keys to move the cursor.

Use the space bar to swap tiles.

To run unit tests:

node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
